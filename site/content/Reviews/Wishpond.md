        <p>The main purpose of these tools is to help create and capture user information for lead purposes. The general idea behind marketing and lead capturing is to create a Landing page, a popup, or a contest in order to get the users attention and to submit their contact information. With this contact information, it is then used to promote a product or service. This is usually done through email, which is where the Marketing Automation tool comes in.

    <h3 id="features">Features</h3>
    <p>Breaking this down into each tool included in Wishpond goes sort of like this:</p>
    
    <div class="file-name">
     <span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">🔷 Landing Page Designer</span>
    </div>
    <div class="highlight"><p>This tool allows the user to create and design their own landing page through an easy to use drag and drop builder. But a good looking landing page is not the only detail you need to obtain success if you’re looking to start a great marketing campaign. Optimization and conversion rates are critical when it comes to building a landing page. And those are the two stats that matter most. <p>
    
    <p>With Wishpond their landing page designer keeps this as the goal, so while it allows you to creatively design the new landing page, it also guides you through the process of optimizing the landing page as much as possible.</p>
    <p>Along with the designer comes a great A/B split testing suite. So that you can start testing different landing page designs, to figure out which works best for your marketing campaign.
    </p>
    <p>This is most likely the first core tool you will be using if you decide to use Wishpond’s marketing tool suite.</p>

    <br>
    
    <div class="file-name">
     <span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">🔷 Popup & Form Creator</span>
    </div>
    <div class="highlight">
    <p>The next tool in Wishpond’s tool suite is their Popup & Form Creator. This tool is somewhat similar to the Landing Page Designer outlined above. The main purpose of this tool is to help create popups and forms for the user to enter their information. <p>
    
    <p>The differentiating factor with a popup or form is that it can be placed on a normal page. Whether that be a blog post or any other type of page. This is important, especially when it comes to marketing a website, as landing pages only get you so far in advertising. Blog posts and articles can help you turn organic searches into powerful contact leads. </p>
    <p>This again comes with the A/B Testing suite to help make sure you can easily optimize your forms and conversion rates.</p>

    <br>
    
    <div class="file-name">
     <span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">🔷 Contests & Promotion Campaigns</span>
    </div>
    <div class="highlight">
    <p>Another very successful avenue for gaining impactful leads, are Contests and Promotions. With this Wishpond tool, you will be able to easily create your own contest to promote to your viewers. <p>
    
    <p>This tool comes with a variety of different contest and promotion types, but here are the top 10:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Sweepstakes</li>
    <li>Photo Contest</li>
    <li>Bonus Entry Contest</li>
    <li>Instagram Hashtag Contest</li>
    <li>Coupon</li>
    <li>Referral Contest</li>
    <li>Vote Contest</li>
    <li>Leaderboard Contest</li>
    <li>Photo Caption Contest</li>
    <li>Video Contest</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>With this variety of contests and promotions, you will easily be able to create your own custom campaign. </p>

     <span style="font-size: 18px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">🔷 Marketing Automation</span>
    </div>
    <div class="highlight">
    <p>The last tool in Wishpond’s arsenal, is also the last logical step in marketing: reaching and advertising to your leads. All of the above tools focus on capturing valuable leads in order to then turn them into sales. Converting those leads to sales can be an especially challenging task. But that’s where the Marketing Automation tool steps in to help. <p>
    
    <p>The Marketing Automation tool allows you to send personalized email campaigns directly to your leads based on a variety of different factors, like demographics and activity. Using this information will allow you to target an audience with much more precision, therefore increasing your conversion rate by a TON. </p>
    <p>All in all, the marketing automation tool has a lot to offer when it comes to converting leads. Each email is tracked and sent to a proper queue. You can easily send any specific emails or queues over to a lead specialist or mark them as a “hot lead”. You can even automate actions for apps you already use! Wishpond allows you to integrate with a ton of different providers such as Aweber, MailChimp, Active Campaign, Survey Monkey and more!</p>

    </div>
    <br>
    
    
    <h3 id="additional">Additional</h3>
    <p>Along with the variety of tools listed above, Wishpond has a great ecosystem for learning and thriving in the marketing world. They have a ton of in-depth guides for things such as lead generation, email drip campaigns, landing page strategies and more.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <h2 id="whatsgood">What's It Good For?</h2>
    
    <h3 id="usecases">Use Cases</h3>
    
    <p>Alright, so let's get down to the actual usage of Wishpond’s tool suite. What is it good for? How would you use this? And what exactly is the benefit?</p>
    <p>Let’s start with the use case. The main use case for a software tool suite like this is for optimizing lead generation. Generating and converting leads to sales can be very tricky. There are many different strategies out there with varying degrees of success. One of the most popular ways to generate leads is through Landing pages and Popups. </p>
    <p>This is where Wishpond thrives. Creating landing pages, popups and even contests/promotions will help you build a successful lead generating campaign. </p>
    <p>Here is an example of a logical lead generation and sales plan:</p>
    
    <ol>
    <li>🔎 User visits a Landing Page or Popup</li>
    <li>✏️ The user inputs their email and name, usually in exchange for some benefit (this could be a coupon, or a new article, or something else)</li>
    <li>❤️ Using this information you build rapport with the user through useful information</li>
    <li>📰 Once rapport has been built, you start selling them on your product or service</li>
    <li>💲 $$$ Profit from sale generated</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3 id="benefits">Benefits</h3>
    <p>Each step in the process shown above can be difficult in itself, and there are many tools built around optimizing each of these steps. In this case, Wishpond has created an entire tool suite to handle optimization and creation of each of these steps. </p>
    <p>The main benefit of using a software tool suite such as this is the ease of integration between each tool. Normally you would need to go out and buy each individual tool to start optimizing and piecing together your marketing campaign. Because they’re all bundled together, moving from lead to rapport building to pitching a sale becomes infinitely easier.</p>
    
    <h3 id="notgood">Not Good At</h3>
    <p>But, what about the bad side of bundling all these tools together? Well, in this case, we can see that some of the tools in Wishpond’s software suite can lack a little bit in advanced functionality. The landing page designer and popup form creator are great for design but lack advanced features like analytics integrations.</p>
    <p>As for their Marketing Automation, you will find that you want to integrate with a more pronounced email marketing tool like Constant Contact, Aweber or MailChimp. </p>
    <p>Overall, the software suite has a lot of great tools and surprisingly have a lot of polish. So there isn't much bad to say here.</p>
    
    <h2 id="review">Wishpond Review</h2>
    
    <h3 id="experience">My Experience</h3>
    <p>So, when it comes down to it, is Wishpond worth it? In my experience with lead generation, creating a high converting landing page can be tough. It gets especially hard when you need to gather together multiple tools for things like A/B testing, Landing Page Design, and Conversion Optimization. Because Wishpond solves this issue with bringing together a bundle of tools that allow you to seamlessly integrate the entire process, it creates a much MUCH better experience. </p>
    <p>Their landing page designer is great for beginners and advanced users alike, because of its powerful yet simplistic design. I was easily able to create high converting landing pages, in less than 30 minutes. Combining this with the A/B Testing suite and the analytics to improve the conversion rate, I had great success for something that took barely any time.</p>
    <p>Comparing this experience to something like Leadpages or Unbounce was fairly similar. I would say that Leadpages and Unbounce have a lot more templates and things to use to create really well crafted landing pages, but in this case, it lacks a lot of the integrations that WIshpond has. </p>
    <p>The popup and form creator was a great addition to easily put up a form; But it’s a rather easy task, so there's nothing much special here, except for the ease of integration with the other tools.</p>
    <p>The Marketing Automation tool really brought the tool suite together. Without it, I would say you’re much better off going with a specialized landing page designer; But I had a great time being able to easily switch over from lead generation to sales pitching. The automation was seamless and worked wonders.</p>
    
    <img src="/wishpond/Leads.png" alt="Wishpond's landing page designer screen" />
    
    <h3 id="whofor">Who Is It For?</h3>
    
    <p>If you are looking to either start your lead generation and sales pitching or trying to simplify your already existing marketing plan; I would highly suggest using Wishpond. </p>
    <p>Really, it comes down to the simplicity and ease of use that comes with integrating all these tools together. I would say that Wishpond is especially great for beginners and smaller companies. Because of the integrations, you will find optimizing the entire funnel very easy. </p>
    <p>That being said, I would say its also good for advanced users as well. In fact, the only users I would not recommend to use Wishpond are larger companies who need the BEST of the best of each type of tool.</p>
    
    <p><b>Great For:</b></p>
    <p>✔️ Beginners + Advanced Users</p>
    <p>✔️ Those looking to simplify their lead generation funnel</p>
    
    <p><b>Not For:</b></p>
    <p>❌ Larger companies looking for the top rated landing page designer, or marketing automation tool.</p>
    
    <h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Overall, Wishpond is a highly polished marketing tool suite. </li>
    <li>It’s great for beginners and advanced users alike. </li>
